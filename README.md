# Tag Tender

## Description

This is an app intended for public use that will keep track of climbable routes within a rock climbing gym. Major features of the app will include a userâ€™s ability to view route details and leave three types of feedback on a given route: perceived grade accuracy, rank overall quality, and optional additional comments. After submission, users will also be able to review their feedback and edit or remove it.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).

(View Raw will give you the markdown that you can copy to your repos!)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- List other prerequisites here

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
